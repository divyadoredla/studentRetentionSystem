# studentRetentionSystem
A **Student Retention System** using **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Deep Learning (DL)** predicts which students are at risk of dropping out by analyzing academic, behavioral, and demographic data. ML models like **Random Forest**, **Logistic Regression**, and **XGBoost** identify key factors affecting retention, such as attendance, grades, and engagement. DL models like **Neural Networks** and **LSTMs** capture complex patterns and temporal trends in student performance. These systems help institutions take early interventions, improve student success, and enhance overall retention rates.


Developed a predictive analytics system to identify students at risk of dropout using Machine Learning (XGBoost, Random Forest) and Deep Learning (ANN, ANN + Genetic Algorithm).

Applied feature engineering, data normalization, and hyperparameter optimization to enhance model performance and reliability.

Achieved 94–95% accuracy with the ANN + GA model, outperforming traditional ML baselines and demonstrating strong predictive capability.
